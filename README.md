🚀 Netflix Data Analysis Project | Python (Pandas & NumPy)

I’m excited to share my latest data analysis project where I explored and analyzed Netflix movies and TV shows data using Python 🐍.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed raw Netflix data

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Analyzed content by type, country, release year, genre, and ratings

Used Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations

Extracted meaningful insights and trends from real-world data

📊 Key Insights:

Growth trends of Netflix content over the years

Comparison between Movies vs TV Shows

Popular genres and content distribution by country

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

This project helped me strengthen my data cleaning, analysis, and problem-solving skills and improved my understanding of working with real datasets.

💡 I’m continuously learning and building projects to grow as a Data Analyst / Python Developer.
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
